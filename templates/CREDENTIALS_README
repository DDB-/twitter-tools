This file is intended to show you how to setup your credentials file, how to name it and where to put the file upon creating it.

Instructions:
1. In the root directory of the project (twitter-tools), create a directory called 'credentials'
2. Copy the template file found in this directory to that folder and rename it in the following fashion:
[Twitter Handle]-Credentials1.txt, where you replace [Twitter Handle] with your twitter handle. 
Note: While the file is not required to be named this way, anything appearing in front of -Credentials1.txt will be used in building the interactive twitter prompt and will be displayed to the user.
3. Replace the values in the template with the values for you Twitter Credentials.
Don't have credentials? Head over to https://dev.twitter.com and register a free application. The values needed should all be listed under OAuth settings on the main app page.
4. You are now ready to run the Twitter Shell!

IMPORTANT: The values that you have copied into your new credentials file are highly sensitive. If another user was to gain access to them they would have the full ability to do any task that you are able to do from the Twitter web interface.
